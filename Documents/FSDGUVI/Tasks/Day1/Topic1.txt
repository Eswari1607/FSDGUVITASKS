Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2:

"HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol"

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the backbone of data communication on the web. As technology evolves, so do the 
protocols that support it. HTTP/1.1 has been a stalwart for many years, but the introduction of HTTP/2 brings significant 
improvements. In this blog, weâ€™ll explore the key differences between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2, highlighting how these changes 
enhance web performance and user experience.

1) Connection Management:
HTTP/1.1
In HTTP/1.1, maintaining connections can be cumbersome. The protocol does support persistent connections, but the limitations 
in multiplexing.

HTTP/2
HTTP/2 is designed for better connection management. With multiplexing and reduced overhead, it requires fewer connections overall. 
This leads to less strain on both clients and servers and can improve the performance of applications, especially in environments.

2) Binary Protocol vs. Text-Based Protocol:

HTTP/1.1
HTTP/1.1 is a text-based protocol, meaning that all the data is sent as readable text. While this is human-readable
, it can be less efficient for machines to process, resulting in overhead.

HTTP/2
HTTP/2 uses a binary protocol, which means data is sent in binary format. This not only makes it more efficient for machines 
to process but also allows for better error handling and communication between client and server.

3) Multiplexing:

HTTP/1.1
In HTTP/1.1, each request and response is handled sequentially over a single connection. This means that if a browser requests
 multiple resources (like images, stylesheets, and scripts), each one has to wait for the previous one to finish before it can be sent. 
 This limitation can lead to increased latency and slow loading times, especially on resource-heavy pages.

HTTP/2
HTTP/2 introduces multiplexing, allowing multiple requests and responses to be sent simultaneously over a single connection. 
This means that browsers can request multiple resources at once without waiting, significantly reducing latency and improving page
 load times.

Conclusion
The evolution from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2 marks a significant advancement in web communication. With features like multiplexing, 
header compression, stream prioritization, server push, and a binary protocol, HTTP/2 offers a faster, more efficient web experience.
